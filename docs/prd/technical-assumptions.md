# Technical Assumptions

## Repository Structure: Monorepo
Single repository containing all coaching platform services - transcript processing, AI analysis, search indexing, and web interface - enabling easier coordination and shared utilities while maintaining clear service boundaries.

## Service Architecture
**Microservices within Monorepo:** Separate services for transcript processing, AI analysis, natural language search, coach interface, and data export, deployed as independent components but developed together. This provides scaling flexibility while avoiding premature architectural complexity.

## Testing Requirements
**Unit + Integration Testing:** Comprehensive unit tests for AI prompt engineering and data processing logic, integration tests for search functionality and coach workflows, with emphasis on testing the natural language query accuracy and iterative refinement features.

## Additional Technical Assumptions and Requests

**Data Storage & Search Architecture:**
- **Primary Database:** PostgreSQL for structured coaching data with full-text search capabilities
- **Vector Database:** Pinecone or similar for semantic search and natural language querying of historical notes
- **Search Engine:** Elasticsearch or similar for fast tag-based filtering and complex queries
- **Data Export:** Standardized JSON/CSV export pipeline with schema versioning

**Platform and Infrastructure:**
- **Cloud Platform:** AWS with auto-scaling for variable coaching session loads
- **API Framework:** FastAPI (Python) for backend services and coach interface APIs
- **Frontend:** React/Next.js for responsive coach interface and chat-based interactions
- **Real-time Features:** WebSocket support for live chat interface during content refinement

**AI and Processing:**
- **LLM Provider:** OpenAI GPT-4 for transcript analysis, content generation, and natural language search
- **Prompt Management:** Version-controlled prompt templates with A/B testing capabilities
- **Voice Learning:** Coach communication pattern analysis and style adaptation algorithms
- **Processing Pipeline:** Asynchronous job queue for batch session processing

**Integration Architecture:**
- **Transcript Input:** Flexible ingestion supporting Zoom, manual upload, and API integration
- **Export Pipeline:** Automated data sync capabilities for future CRM integration
- **Webhook Infrastructure:** Real-time notifications and coach alert system
- **Authentication:** JWT-based auth with role-based access for coach leads vs. team coaches
