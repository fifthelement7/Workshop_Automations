# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision
The platform prioritizes trust-building through conversational AI collaboration for internal coaching workflows. Coaches receive email notifications and engage through chat-based interfaces that feel like working with an intelligent assistant. The experience emphasizes transparency - coaches can see AI reasoning, provide feedback, and iteratively refine outputs before sending client communications.

## Key Interaction Paradigms
- **Conversational Interface Priority:** Natural language chat for all review and editing tasks
- **Email-to-Interface Workflow:** Direct links from notifications to coaching session review
- **Iterative Refinement:** Back-and-forth dialogue allowing coaches to build trust with AI analysis
- **Batch Processing Views:** Handle multiple client summaries from single coaching sessions

## Core Screens and Views
- **Coach Review Interface:** Chat-based content validation and refinement workspace
- **Coach Lead Dashboard:** Team oversight with coaching quality and client progress tracking
- **Natural Language Search Interface:** Conversational querying across all coaching notes ("Show me clients struggling with implementation")
- **Client Summary Views:** Structured narrative + bullet format optimized for readability
- **Internal Team Notes:** Coach lead annotations and performance observations
- **Export Management:** Data export tools for future CRM integration
