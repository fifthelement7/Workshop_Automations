# Goals and Background Context

## Goals
- Eliminate the 90% follow-up failure rate in coaching sessions by automating personalized client communications
- Reduce coach administrative overhead from 2-3 hours to 20-30 minutes per session
- Enable practitioner supervision of health coaching teams with clinical safety and compliance
- Build trust between coaches and AI through iterative collaboration and refinement capabilities
- Establish first-mover advantage in the "coaching supervision" platform category
- Scale coaching operations 50% without proportional administrative growth

## Background Context

The coaching industry faces a critical supervision and quality assurance crisis. Current coaching platforms focus on scheduling and basic tracking, completely missing the supervision workflows that ensure quality, compliance, and client outcomes. This gap is particularly acute in health coaching, where practitioners need oversight of coaching teams but lack tools to monitor session quality or identify clinical escalations.

Our solution positions as the first comprehensive coaching quality assurance platform, combining AI-powered session analysis with iterative coach collaboration and multi-stakeholder supervision workflows. Unlike existing automation tools that create "black box" outputs, we build trust through chat-based refinement interfaces that let coaches validate and improve AI-generated content before automation.
