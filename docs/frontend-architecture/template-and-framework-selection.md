# Template and Framework Selection

This frontend architecture is designed for the Coaching Supervision & Automation Platform, building upon the backend architecture and implementing the UI/UX specifications for the Mindscribe interface. No starter template is being used - this is a custom Next.js 14 implementation optimized for the coach workflow and real-time chat refinement features.
