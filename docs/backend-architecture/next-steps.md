# Next Steps

## Frontend Architecture

Since this project includes a comprehensive React/Next.js user interface as defined in the front-end specification, the next step is to create a detailed Frontend Architecture Document using the Frontend Architecture mode.

**Frontend Architect Prompt:**
Create the Frontend Architecture Document for the Coaching Supervision & Automation Platform using:
- This backend architecture document as the technical foundation
- The front-end specification (front-end-spec.md) for UI/UX requirements
- Focus on the React/Next.js implementation with TypeScript
- Detail the chat-based refinement interface using WebSockets
- Specify component architecture for the iterative AI collaboration workflow
- Ensure alignment with the backend API specifications defined here

## Implementation Steps

1. Complete Frontend Architecture Document
2. Set up development environment with Docker Compose
3. Initialize Terraform infrastructure for development
4. Implement Epic 1 stories starting with database schema
5. Deploy to staging environment for validation
